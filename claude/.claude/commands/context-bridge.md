# Context Bridge Command

Create a session bridge document to continue work in a new Claude Code session.

## Usage

```bash
/context-bridge              # Auto-generated filename with timestamp only
/context-bridge description  # Custom description added to filename
```

## Your Task

1. **Analyze recent conversation** to understand project context and progress
2. **Create bridge document** at:
   - With description: `scratchpads/context-bridge-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-description.md`
   - Without description: `scratchpads/context-bridge-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`
3. **Copy continuation prompt** to clipboard with `pbcopy`
4. **Display confirmation** with file location and copied prompt

## Continuation Prompt Template

```text
I'm continuing work on [PROJECT_NAME] from a previous Claude Code session. Please read the context bridge document at:

[BRIDGE_FILE_PATH]

This document contains:
- Complete project overview and current status
- Technical details and configuration states
- Recent progress and next steps
- All necessary context to resume work seamlessly

Key points for continuation:
- [Current status in one line]

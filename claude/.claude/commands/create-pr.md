# Create Pull Request Command

Create a pull request from the current branch with proper formatting and issue linking.

## Command Options

- `--draft`: Create as draft PR
- `--skip-issue-link`: Skip automatic issue linking

## Your task

1. **Verify prerequisites**:
   - Confirm current branch is not `main`/`master`
   - Check that branch has commits ahead of base branch
   - Ensure branch is pushed to remote (push if needed)

2. **Generate PR title**:
   - Use branch name as fallback
   - If single commit ahead: use commit message as title
   - If multiple commits: create descriptive title based on branch name and commit themes
   - Follow Conventional Commits format from global CLAUDE.md

3. **Analyze commits for description**:
   - Get commit history: `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`
   - Group commits by type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
   - Identify patterns and overall theme

4. **Create comprehensive description**:
   - **Summary section**: 2-3 bullet points describing what this PR does
   - **Changes section**: Categorized list of changes from commits
   - **Testing section**: How the changes should be tested
   - **Notes section**: Any implementation details or decisions

5. **Identify and link related issues**:
   - **PRIORITY**: Extract issue number from branch name patterns:
     - `fix/gh-123` or `feat/gh-123` ‚Üí Issue #123 (preferred format)
     - `fix/issue-123` or `feat/issue-123` ‚Üí Issue #123 (legacy format)
     - `docs/gh-456` ‚Üí Issue #456
   - Scan commit messages for issue references (#123, fixes #456)
   - Search recent issues for related keywords from commits
   - **CRITICAL**: Include issue reference in PR description:
     - Use "Closes #123" for issues this PR fully resolves
     - Use "Related to #123" for partial fixes or enhancements
     - Use "Addresses #123" for issues that need more work after this PR
   - **VALIDATE**: Confirm issue reference is added to description
   - **If `--skip-issue-link` provided**: Skip automatic issue detection and linking

6. **Create the PR**:
   - Use `gh pr create` with generated title and description
   - Add `--draft` flag if specified
   - Set base branch (usually main/master)

7. **Confirm and display**:
   - Show PR URL
   - Display title and description used
   - **IMPORTANT**: Explicitly confirm which issues were linked (e.g., "‚úÖ Linked to issue #123")
   - If no issues were detected, clearly state "‚ö†Ô∏è No issues were linked to this PR"

# [Project Name] — Implementation Roadmap

This document tracks implementation progress through phased delivery. Phases are ordered by dependency: each phase builds on the infrastructure established by previous phases.

**Progress key:** `[ ]` Not started · `[~]` In progress · `[x]` Complete · `[—]` Deferred / descoped

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Name | Dependencies | Status |
| ------- | ------ | -------------- | -------- |
| 0 | Project Foundation | — | Not started |
| 1 | [Phase 1 Name] | Phase 0 | Not started |
| *Add rows as phases are defined* | | | |

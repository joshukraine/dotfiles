# Claude Configuration Implementation Plan

## Approach: Multiple Atomic Commits

Breaking down the changes into logical, reviewable commits that can be merged independently.

## Proposed Commit Sequence

### Phase 1: Remove Redundancy (Foundation)

**Commit 1: Streamline global CLAUDE.md**

- Remove duplicate commit guidelines (keep reference to standards)
- Remove detailed scratchpad instructions (keep reference to command)
- Focus on high-level principles and standards
- Add clear references to commands for implementation details

**Commit 2: Update existing commands to reference global standards**

- Update commit.md to reference global CLAUDE.md for conventions
- Update fix-github-issue.md to reference global scratchpad standards
- Remove duplicate best practices from commands

### Phase 2: Add Critical Missing Commands

**Commit 3: Add /create-pr command**

- Implement PR creation workflow
- Include automatic PR title generation from commits
- Add issue linking and description templates
- Test with actual PR creation

**Commit 4: Add /update-deps command**

- Implement dependency update workflow
- Support for npm, pip, bundler, etc.
- Include testing between updates
- Add breaking change documentation

**Commit 5: Add /init-project command**

- Project initialization workflow
- README template creation
- Scratchpad setup integration
- Basic configuration files

### Phase 3: Simplify Existing Commands

**Commit 6: Simplify fix-github-issue command**

- Consolidate research phases
- Make scratchpad optional
- Add quick-fix mode
- Maintain backward compatibility

**Commit 7: Optimize review-pr command**

- Make automated detection truly optional
- Simplify default behavior
- Keep advanced features available via flags

### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation

**Commit 8: Add command discovery system**

- Create /help command listing all available commands
- Add brief descriptions for each command
- Include usage examples

**Commit 9: Add command aliases**

- Implement short aliases for common commands
- Document alias system
- Ensure backward compatibility

**Commit 10: Final cleanup and documentation**

- Update main README with new command structure
- Remove analysis document (no longer needed)
- Add migration guide for users

## Implementation Order Rationale

1. **Foundation First**: Removing redundancy creates a clean base
2. **Add Before Modify**: New commands won't break existing workflows
3. **Simplify Carefully**: Modifying existing commands requires care to maintain compatibility
4. **Polish Last**: Discovery and aliases are nice-to-have features

## Testing Strategy

- Test each command in isolation after implementation
- Verify backward compatibility for modified commands
- Run through common workflows end-to-end
- Get user feedback on simplified workflows

## Rollback Strategy

Each commit is atomic and can be reverted independently if issues arise.

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1, Commit 1: Streamline global CLAUDE.md
2. Test the changes locally
3. Get user confirmation before proceeding to next commit
4. Continue iteratively through all phases

This approach allows for:

- Incremental progress with testing
- Easy rollback if needed
- Clear commit history
- Parallel work on different phases if desired

## Common Commands

### Setup and Installation

**üìö For comprehensive setup guidance, see [docs/setup/](docs/setup/README.md)**

```bash
# Initial setup (idempotent)
bash ~/dotfiles/setup.sh

# Install Homebrew packages
brew bundle install

# Install Zap (Zsh plugin manager)
# Follow instructions at https://www.zapzsh.com with --keep flag
```

- **Issues**: [Troubleshooting](docs/setup/troubleshooting.md)
- **Customization**: [Customization Guide](docs/setup/customization.md)

### Configuration Validation

```bash
# Validate all configurations
./scripts/validate-config.sh

# Run with auto-fix for common issues
./scripts/validate-config.sh --fix

# Run specific validator (shell-syntax, abbreviations, environment, dependencies, markdown)
./scripts/validate-config.sh --validator markdown

# Setup git hooks for automatic validation
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

### Testing and Linting

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite (must be run from dotfiles root)
./scripts/run-tests

# Run specific test categories
./scripts/run-tests git         # Git function tests
./scripts/run-tests abbr        # Abbreviation tests
./scripts/run-tests --verbose   # Verbose output
./scripts/run-tests --perf      # Performance timing

# Lint shell scripts (must be run from dotfiles root)
./scripts/lint-shell

# Lint with minimal output
./scripts/lint-shell --quiet

# Skip test files during linting
./scripts/lint-shell --exclude-tests
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to dotfiles
cdot

# Navigate to config directories
cdxc    # ~/.config
cdnv    # ~/.config/nvim
cdfi    # ~/.config/fish

# Git operations (using custom abbreviations)
ga      # git add
gaa     # git add --all
gcm     # git cm (custom commit script)
gst     # git status
```

### Shell Management

Both Fish and Zsh configurations provide 90% functional parity with the same abbreviations and functions.

**Zsh-specific:**

```bash
src     # source ~/.zshrc
```

**Fish-specific:**

```bash
fish_config  # Open Fish configuration UI
```

### Tmux Management

Common tmux commands and abbreviations available:

```bash
tl      # tmux ls (list sessions)
tlw     # tmux list-windows
tn      # Create new tmux session with name
tna     # Create/attach to session named after current directory
ta      # Attach to existing tmux session
tk      # Kill tmux session
tka     # Kill all tmux sessions
tsrc    # Source tmux configuration
mux     # tmuxinator (session management)
```

## Architecture Notes

### Dual Shell Support

The repository maintains parallel configurations for both Zsh and Fish shells:

- **Shared configuration framework** eliminates duplication:
  - `shared/environment.sh` and `shared/environment.fish` - Common environment variables
  - `shared/abbreviations.yaml` - Single source for all 196+ abbreviations
  - Shell-specific files generated via `shared/generate-*-abbr.sh` scripts
- Both use Starship for consistent prompting
- Fish uses native abbreviations, Zsh uses zsh-abbr plugin for Fish-like behavior
- Smart git functions with automatic branch detection (gpum, grbm, gcom, gbrm)

### Stow-based Symlink Management

- GNU Stow creates symlinks from dotfiles directory to `$HOME`
- `setup.sh` script handles conflict detection and backup
- Each subdirectory represents a "package" that can be stowed independently
- Script is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely

#### Ignoring Directories from Stow

Some directories contain repository infrastructure and should not be symlinked to `$HOME`. The `setup.sh` script loops through all directories and runs `stow package/` on each one individually.

**To ignore a directory from stow operations:**

1. Create a `.stow-local-ignore` file in the root of the directory
2. Add the pattern `.+ # Ignore everything` to ignore all contents

**Example directories using this pattern:**

- `agents/` - Claude Code sub-agents documentation
- `docs/` - Repository documentation
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `tests/` - Test files and fixtures
- `shared/` - Shared configuration generators
- `scratchpads/` - Temporary development files

**Important:** Do not add directory names to the root `.stow-local-ignore` file - this has no effect since stow runs on individual packages, not the entire repository.

### Neovim Configuration

- Uses LazyVim distribution as base configuration
- Custom plugins and overrides in `nvim/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/`
- Configuration follows LazyVim conventions and structure

### Terminal Environment

- Primary terminal: ghostty (GPU-accelerated, modern terminal)
- Alternative: kitty (also GPU-accelerated with native split support)
- Font setup includes Nerd Font symbols for icons without patched fonts
- Tmux installed and configured by default for terminal multiplexing

### Package Management

- Homebrew via `brew/Brewfile` for system packages and applications
- asdf for runtime version management (Node.js, Ruby, etc.)
- Fonts installed via Homebrew Cask Fonts

## Important Files

- `setup.sh` - Main installation script
- `brew/Brewfile` - Homebrew package definitions
- `shared/abbreviations.yaml` - **Single source of truth for all abbreviations**
- `shared/environment.sh` and `shared/environment.fish` - Shared environment variables
- `shared/generate-*-abbr.sh` - Scripts to generate shell-specific abbreviations
- `fish/.config/fish/abbreviations.fish` - **Generated** Fish shell abbreviations
- `zsh/.config/zsh-abbr/abbreviations.zsh` - **Generated** Zsh abbreviations
- `nvim/.config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua` - LazyVim configuration entry point
- `local/` - Contains example local configuration files for customization

## Shared Configuration System

The dotfiles use a shared configuration framework to eliminate duplication between Fish and Zsh:

### Adding/Modifying Abbreviations

1. Edit `shared/abbreviations.yaml` (single source of truth)
2. Regenerate shell-specific files:

   ```bash
   cd ~/dotfiles/shared
   ./generate-fish-abbr.sh    # Updates fish/.config/fish/abbreviations.fish
   ./generate-zsh-abbr.sh     # Updates zsh/.config/zsh-abbr/abbreviations.zsh
   ```

### Environment Variables

- **Shared**: Edit `shared/environment.sh` and `shared/environment.fish`
- **Shell-specific**: Edit in respective shell configs (`fish/config.fish` or `zsh/.zshrc`)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Never edit generated abbreviation files directly - changes will be overwritten!

## Customization

Local customizations should be placed in `*.local` files:

- `~/.gitconfig.local` - Personal git configuration
- `~/.laptop.local` - Additional laptop setup customizations
- `~/dotfiles/local/config.fish.local` - Fish-specific local configuration

## Scratchpads

For temporary files, notes, and debugging during development work with Claude Code:

- **Location**: Use `scratchpads/` directory (ignored by git)
- **Organization**: Subdirectories by type (`pr-reviews/`, `planning/`, `debugging/`, `notes/`)
- **Naming**: Include timestamps for organization (e.g., `pr-review-70-20250721-211241.md`)
- **Purpose**: Working files that should not be committed to repository

Example structure:

```text
scratchpads/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-reviews/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-review-70-20250721-211241.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ planning/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-3-roadmap-20250721.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ debugging/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shell-function-debug-20250721.md
```

## Platform Support

- **macOS only** - setup script checks for Darwin and exits on other platforms
- **Apple Silicon and Intel** - automatically detects architecture and sets HOMEBREW_PREFIX accordingly
- **XDG Base Directory** support with automatic directory creation

# The font families to use.
#
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
#
#     ghostty +list-fonts
#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
#
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
#
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
#
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
#
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.

#
# You can also use these fields to completely disable a font style. If you set
# the value of the configuration below to literal `false` then that font style
# will be disabled. If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled
# font style, the regular font style will be used instead.
#
# These are only valid if its corresponding font-family is also specified. If
# no font-family is specified, then the font-style is ignored unless you're

# Control whether Ghostty should synthesize a style if the requested style is
# not available in the specified font-family.
#
# Ghostty can synthesize bold, italic, and bold italic styles if the font
# does not have a specific style. For bold, this is done by drawing an
# outline around the glyph of varying thickness. For italic, this is done by
# applying a slant to the glyph. For bold italic, both of these are applied.
#
# Synthetic styles are not perfect and will generally not look as good
# as a font that has the style natively. However, they are useful to
# provide styled text when the font does not have the style.
#
# Set this to "false" or "true" to disable or enable synthetic styles
# completely. You can disable specific styles using "no-bold", "no-italic",
# and "no-bold-italic". You can disable multiple styles by separating them
# with a comma. For example, "no-bold,no-italic".
#
# Available style keys are: `bold`, `italic`, `bold-italic`.
#
# If synthetic styles are disabled, then the regular style will be used
# instead if the requested style is not available. If the font has the
# requested style, then the font will be used as-is since the style is
# not synthetic.
#
# Warning: An easy mistake is to disable `bold` or `italic` but not
# `bold-italic`. Disabling only `bold` or `italic` will NOT disable either
# in the `bold-italic` style. If you want to disable `bold-italic`, you must
# explicitly disable it. You cannot partially disable `bold-italic`.
#
# By default, synthetic styles are enabled.

#
# A valid value is the name of a feature. Prefix the feature with a `-` to
# explicitly disable it. Example: `ss20` or `-ss20`.
#
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).

# a variable font. A variable font is a single font, usually with a filename

# tool.
#
# Invalid ids and values are usually ignored. For example, if a font only
# supports weights from 100 to 700, setting `wght=800` will do nothing (it
# will not be clamped to 700). You must consult your font's documentation to
# see what values are supported.

# The method to use for calculating the cell width of a grapheme cluster.

# grapheme width. This results in correct grapheme width but may result in
# cursor-desync issues with some programs (such as shells) that may use a
# legacy method such as `wcswidth`.
#
# Valid values are:
#
# * `legacy` - Use a legacy method to determine grapheme width, such as
#   wcswidth This maximizes compatibility with legacy programs but may result
#   in incorrect grapheme width for certain graphemes such as skin-tone

#   behavior is undefined and we want to retain the ability to modify it.

# A theme to use. This can be a built-in theme name, a custom theme
# name, or an absolute path to a custom theme file. Ghostty also supports
# specifying a different theme to use for light and dark mode. Each
# option is documented below.
#
# If the theme is an absolute pathname, Ghostty will attempt to load that
# file as a theme. If that file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error
# will be logged and no other directories will be searched.
#
# If the theme is not an absolute pathname, two different directories will be
# searched for a file name that matches the theme. This is case sensitive on
# systems with case-sensitive filesystems. It is an error for a theme name to
# include path separators unless it is an absolute pathname.
#
# The first directory is the `themes` subdirectory of your Ghostty
# configuration directory. This is `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/ghostty/themes` or
# `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
#
# The second directory is the `themes` subdirectory of the Ghostty resources
# directory. Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed
# into this directory. On macOS, this list is in the
# `Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes` directory. On Linux, this
# list is in the `share/ghostty/themes` directory (wherever you installed the
# Ghostty "share" directory.
#
# To see a list of available themes, run `ghostty +list-themes`.
#
# A theme file is simply another Ghostty configuration file. They share
# the same syntax and same configuration options. A theme can set any valid
# configuration option so please do not use a theme file from an untrusted
# source. The built-in themes are audited to only set safe configuration
# options.
#
# Some options cannot be set within theme files. The reason these are not
# supported should be self-evident. A theme file cannot set `theme` or
# `config-file`. At the time of writing this, Ghostty will not show any
# warnings or errors if you set these options in a theme file but they will
# be silently ignored.
#
# Any additional colors specified via background, foreground, palette, etc.
# will override the colors specified in the theme.
#
# To specify a different theme for light and dark mode, use the following
# syntax: `light:theme-name,dark:theme-name`. For example:
# `light:rose-pine-dawn,dark:rose-pine`. Whitespace around all values are
# trimmed and order of light and dark does not matter. Both light and dark
# must be specified in this form. In this form, the theme used will be
# based on the current desktop environment theme.
#
# There are some known bugs with light/dark mode theming. These will
# be fixed in a future update:
#
#   - macOS: titlebar tabs style is not updated when switching themes.

# this at runtime works but will only affect the next terminal surface
# if it is the first one ever created.
#
# If you're using the `ghostty` CLI there is also a shortcut to set this
# with arguments directly: you can use the `-e` flag. For example: `ghostty -e
# fish --with --custom --args`. The `-e` flag automatically forces some
# other behaviors as well:
#
#   * `gtk-single-instance=false` - This ensures that a new instance is
#     launched and the CLI args are respected.
#
#   * `quit-after-last-window-closed=true` - This ensures that the Ghostty
#     process will exit when the command exits. Additionally, the
#     `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset.
#
#   * `shell-integration=detect` (if not `none`) - This prevents forcibly
#     injecting any configured shell integration into the command's
#     environment. With `-e` its highly unlikely that you're executing a
#     shell and forced shell integration is likely to cause problems
#     (i.e. by wrapping your command in a shell, setting env vars, etc.).
#     This is a safety measure to prevent unexpected behavior. If you want

# it was launched from a desktop launcher, then it defaults to `home`.
#
# The value of this must be an absolute value or one of the special values
# below:
#
#   * `home` - The home directory of the executing user.
#
#   * `inherit` - The working directory of the launching process.

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values. The list of actions is available in
# the documentation or using the `ghostty +list-actions` command.
#
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`.
#
# Valid keys are currently only listed in the
# [Ghostty source code](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/d6e76858164d52cff460fedc61ddf2e560912d71/src/input/key.zig#L255).
# This is a documentation limitation and we will improve this in the future.
# A common gotcha is that numeric keys are written as words: i.e. `one`,
# `two`, `three`, etc. and not `1`, `2`, `3`. This will also be improved in
# the future.
#
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
#
# Note: The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
# modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
# that Ghostty uses.
#
# Some additional notes for triggers:
#
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
#
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
#
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
#
#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
#     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
#     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
#     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
#
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
#
# Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
#
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
#
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (i.e. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
#
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
#
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
#
#   * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
#     triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
#
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
#
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
#
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#
#   * All other actions can be found in the documentation or by using the
#     `ghostty +list-actions` command.
#
# Some notes for the action:
#
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
#
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
#
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
#
# The keybind trigger can be prefixed with some special values to change
# the behavior of the keybind. These are:
#
#   * `all:` - Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
#     keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
#     then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
#     applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
#     are already global (i.e. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.
#
#   * `global:` - Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
#     within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
#     sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
#     globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused),
#     specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
#     work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
#     information.
#
#   * `unconsumed:` - Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind
#     will consume the input, meaning that the associated encoding (if
#     any) will not be sent to the running program in the terminal. If
#     you wish to send the encoded value to the program, specify the
#     `unconsumed:` prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
#     `unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`. `global:` and `all:`-prefixed
#     keybinds will always consume the input regardless of this setting.
#     Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface,
#     they're never encoded.
#
# Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
# `ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
# set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
# `global:` keybind will be used.
#
# Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
# `global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
# and not consume the input to reload the config.
#
# Note: `global:` is only supported on macOS. On macOS,
# this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted to Ghostty.
# When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched or reloaded,
# Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions. If the permissions are
# not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS, you can find these
# permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

# one side. If this is `false`, the top left grid cell will always hug the
# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
#
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still

# The "transparent" style will also update in real-time to dynamic
# changes to the window background color, i.e. via OSC 11. To make this
# more aesthetically pleasing, this only happens if the terminal is
# a window, tab, or split that borders the top of the window. This
# avoids a disjointed appearance where the titlebar color changes
# but all the topmost terminals don't match.

# however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have
# squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect
# existing windows in buggy ways. The top titlebar area of the window will
# continue to drag the window around and you will not be able to use
# the mouse for terminal events in this space.

# undesirable if you want to use "option" as an "alt" key for keybindings
# in terminal programs or shells.

# This configuration lets you change the behavior so that option is treated
# as alt.
#
# The default behavior (unset) will depend on your active keyboard
# layout. If your keyboard layout is one of the keyboard layouts listed

# value is "false". Keyboard layouts with a default value of "true" are:
#
#   - U.S. Standard

#
# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key.
#
# You may set this to `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode
# sequences but this will break terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.

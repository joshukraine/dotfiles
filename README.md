# My Dotfiles for macOS

![dotfiles screenshot][screenshot]

These are the dotfiles I use on my Macs, currently running [macOS High Sierra (10.13)][high-sierra]. They are geared primarily towards Ruby-based web development using Zsh (via [Oh-My-Zsh][oh-my-zsh]), Vim, and Tmux. Also included are my [iTerm2][iterm2] and [Terminal.app][terminal] profiles.

## Mac Bootstrap Script

This repo previously contained my entire provisioning solution for a new machine running a fresh install of macOS. I've now extracted the provisioning functionality into its own repository. Check it out:

&#9657; **Provision a new Mac with [Mac Bootstrap][mac-bootstrap].**

NOTE: Mac Bootstrap automatically clones and installs this dotfiles repo.

## Prerequisites

The dotfiles assume you are running macOS with the following software pre-installed:

* [Oh-My-Zsh][oh-my-zsh]
* [Homebrew][homebrew]
* [Vim][vim]
* [Git][git]
* [Tmux][tmux]
* [Ruby][ruby]
* [asdf][asdf]

All of the above and more are included in [Mac Bootstrap][mac-bootstrap]

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/joshukraine/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
. ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```

## Post-install Tasks

After running `install.sh` there are still a couple of things that need to be done.

* Set up iTerm2 or Terminal.app profile (see details below).
* Add personal data to `~/.gitconfig.local` and `~/.zshrc.local`.
* Complete [Brew Bundle][brew-bundle] with `brew bundle install`

## Setting up iTerm2

Thanks to a [great blog post][blog-post] by Trevor Brown, I learned that you can quickly set up iTerm2 by exporting your profile. Here are the steps.

1. Open iTerm2.
1. Select iTerm2 > Preferences.
1. Under the General tab, check the box labeled "Load preferences from a custom folder or URL:"
1. Press "Browse" and point it to `~/dotfiles/iterm2/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`.
1. Restart iTerm2.

## Setting up Terminal.app

Getting set up after a fresh install is simple.

1. Open Terminal.app.
1. Select Terminal > Preferences. (But really you'll just press &#8984;, right? So much faster.)
1. Select the Profiles tab.
1. Click the gear icon and select Import...
1. Select `~/dotfiles/terminal/<desired-profile>.terminal` and click Open.
1. Click the Default button to keep using this profile in new Terminal windows.

## A Note about Vim performance and Ruby files

I recently discovered a resolution to some significant performance issues I had been experiencing running Vim on macOS. These issues were particularly painful when editing Ruby files. I've documented what I learned here:

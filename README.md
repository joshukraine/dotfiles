## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

The dotfiles assume you are running macOS with (at minimum) the following software pre-installed:

- [Git][git]
- [Homebrew][homebrew] (including [coreutils][coreutils])
- [asdf][asdf]
- [Ruby][ruby]
- [Node.js][nodejs]
- [Zsh][zsh] and/or [Fish][fish]
- [Neovim][neovim]
- [Starship][starship]
- [`yq`][yq] (for regenerating abbreviations from shared YAML source)

All of the above and more are installed with my fork of [Laptop][joshuas-laptop].

## üåü New Mac Bootstrap

This is what I would do if I bought a new Mac computer today. The steps below assume you have already completed the basics:

- Log in to iCloud
- Check for software updates
- [Install Xcode Command Line Tools][install-clt]

### üíª 1. Run my fork of thoughtbot‚Äôs Laptop

&#9657; **[github.com/joshukraine/laptop][joshuas-laptop]**

Download the `mac` script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshukraine/laptop/main/mac
```

Download `.local.laptop` for additional customizations:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshukraine/dotfiles/master/laptop/.laptop.local
```

Review both scripts before proceeding:

```sh
less mac
```

```sh
less .laptop.local
```

Execute the `mac` script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

I‚Äôve made the following changes to my fork of Laptop:

- Install asdf via git instead of Homebrew
- Comment out Heroku-related code
- Comment out unused Homebrew taps and formulae

It is worth noting that the Laptop script (`mac`) is idempotent and can be safely run multiple times to ensure a consistent baseline configuration.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Check for Stow conflicts

The dotfiles `setup.sh` script uses [GNU Stow][gnu-stow] to symlink all the config files to your `$HOME` directory. If you already have an identically-named file/directory in `$HOME` (e.g. `~/.zshrc` leftover from installing Laptop), this will cause a conflict, and Stow will (rightly) abort with an error.

The setup script will try to detect and backup these files ahead of Stow, but it‚Äôs still a good idea to check your `$HOME` directory as well as `$HOME/.config` and `$HOME/.local/bin`.

### üìç 3. Clone and setup the dotfiles

Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/joshukraine/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

Read and preview

```sh
less ~/dotfiles/setup.sh
~/dotfiles/setup.sh --help
~/dotfiles/setup.sh --dry-run  # Preview changes without applying them
```

Setup

```sh
~/dotfiles/setup.sh
```

If you do encounter Stow conflicts, resolve these and run setup again. The script is idempotent, so you can run it multiple times safely.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è 4. Install Zap

[Zap][zap] describes itself as a _‚Äúminimal zsh plugin manager that does what you expect.‚Äù_

&#9657; **[zapzsh.com][zap]**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After copying/pasting the install command for Zap, be sure to add the `--keep` flag to prevent Zap from replacing you existing `.zshrc` file.

### üç∫ 5. Install remaining Homebrew packages

Review the included `Brewfile` and make desired adjustments.

```sh
less ~/Brewfile
```

Install the bundle.

```sh
brew bundle install
```

### üõ†Ô∏è 6. Complete post-install tasks

- [ ] Launch LazyVim (`nvim`) and run [`:checkhealth`][checkhealth]. Resolve errors and warnings. Plugins should install automatically on first launch.
- [ ] Add personal data as needed to `*.local` files such as `~/.gitconfig.local`, `~/.laptop.local`, `~/dotfiles/local/config.fish.local`.
- [ ] (Optional) Set up [1Password CLI][1p-cli-start] for managing secrets.
- [ ] (Optional) Set up [1Password SSH key management][1p-cli-ssh].
- [ ] If using Fish, customize your setup by running the `fish_config` command.
- [ ] Install Tmux plugins with `<prefix> + I` (<https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm>)

## Zsh or Fish?

Having used both Zsh and Fish for several years, I‚Äôve decided to keep my configs for both. One thing I particularly love about Fish is the concept of [abbreviations over aliases](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/). Happily, there is now [zsh-abbr][zsh-abbr] which brings this functionality to Zsh.

&#9657; **[Fish abbr docs](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/abbr.html)**

My Zsh and Fish configs have 95% functional parity via shared configuration:

- Same prompt (Starship)
- Identical abbreviations (250+) generated from single YAML source
- Shared environment variables
- Smart git functions with automatic branch detection

<details>
  <summary><strong>Zsh Setup Instructions</strong></summary>
Zsh is now the default shell on macOS. However, it's helpful to add an entry enabling the Homebrew version of Zsh (`/opt/homebrew/bin/zsh` on Apple Silicon, `/usr/local/bin/zsh` on Intel) instead of the default (`/bin/zsh`) version.

Ensure that you have Zsh from Homebrew. (`which zsh`) If not:

```sh
brew install zsh
```

Add Zsh (Homebrew version) to `/etc/shells`:

```sh
# Apple Silicon Macs:
echo /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

# Intel Macs:
echo /usr/local/bin/zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

# Or use this universal command:
echo $(which zsh) | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
```

Set it as your default shell:

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Install [Zap][zap]. (Required for functional parity with Fish)

Restart your terminal.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Fish Setup Instructions</strong></summary>
Install Fish from Homebrew:

```sh
 brew install fish
```

Add Fish to `/etc/shells`:

```sh
# Apple Silicon Macs:
echo /opt/homebrew/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

# Intel Macs:
echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

# Or use this universal command:
echo $(which fish) | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
```

Set it as your default shell:

```sh
chsh -s $(which fish)
```

Restart your terminal. This will create the `~/.config` and `~/.local` directories if they don‚Äôt already exist.

</details>

## Shared Configuration Framework

The dotfiles use a unified configuration system that eliminates duplication between Fish and Zsh shells:

### Key Components

- **`shared/abbreviations.yaml`** - Single source of truth for all 250+ abbreviations
- **`shared/environment.sh` and `shared/environment.fish`** - Common environment variables
- **`shared/generate-all-abbr.sh`** - Unified script to regenerate abbreviations for all shells
- **`shared/generate-fish-abbr.sh` and `shared/generate-zsh-abbr.sh`** - Individual shell-specific generation scripts

### Adding or Modifying Abbreviations

1. Edit `~/dotfiles/shared/abbreviations.yaml`
2. Regenerate all abbreviations (from any directory):

   ```bash
   reload-abbr    # Available as a shell function - works from anywhere!
   ```

3. Reload your shell configuration:
   - Fish: `exec fish` or open a new terminal
   - Zsh: `src` or open a new terminal

<details>
  <summary><strong>Alternative methods</strong></summary>

**Manual script execution:**

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles/shared
./generate-all-abbr.sh     # Updates both Fish and Zsh abbreviation files
```

**Individual shell regeneration:**

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles/shared
./generate-fish-abbr.sh    # Updates fish/.config/fish/abbreviations.fish
./generate-zsh-abbr.sh     # Updates zsh/.config/zsh-abbr/abbreviations.zsh
```

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never edit the generated abbreviation files directly - changes will be overwritten!

### Smart Git Functions

The shared configuration includes intelligent git functions that automatically detect your main branch:

- `gpum` - Pull from upstream main/master
- `grbm` - Rebase on main/master
- `gcom` - Checkout main/master
- `gbrm` - Remove branches merged into main/master

These functions work with both `main` and `master` branch names automatically.

## üìö Documentation

reload-abbr

# Or manually from the dotfiles directory
~/dotfiles/shared/generate-all-abbr.sh

# Individual generators (for development)
~/dotfiles/shared/generate-fish-abbr.sh          # Fish abbreviations only
~/dotfiles/shared/generate-zsh-abbr.sh           # Zsh abbreviations only
~/dotfiles/shared/generate-abbreviations-doc.sh  # Documentation only
```

**What gets regenerated automatically:**

- `fish/.config/fish/abbreviations.fish` (288 abbreviations)
- `zsh/.config/zsh-abbr/abbreviations.zsh` (289 abbreviations)
- `docs/abbreviations.md` (complete reference documentation)

**After regeneration:** Reload your shell (`exec fish` or `src`) to use new abbreviations.

## Markdown Linting

This repository includes a complete markdownlint setup for consistent markdown formatting across all projects.

### Features

- **Global Configuration**: Uses `~/.markdownlint.yaml` with sensible defaults:
  - Disabled line length rule (MD013) for better readability
  - Allows common inline HTML elements (`details`, `summary`, `strong`)
  - Supports trailing punctuation including CJK characters
  - Allows bare URLs (MD034 disabled)
- **Shell Abbreviations**: Quick access via `mdl` commands
- **Editor Integration**: Works seamlessly with Neovim/LazyVim
- **CI/CD Support**: Includes sample GitHub Actions workflow

### Usage

```bash
# Install markdownlint-cli2 (if not already installed)
brew bundle install

# Lint files using abbreviations
mdl README.md              # Lint single file
mdlf README.md             # Auto-fix single file
mdla                       # Lint all .md files recursively
mdlaf                      # Fix all .md files recursively

# Or use the global helper script
mdl-global README.md       # Always uses ~/.markdownlint.yaml
```

### CI Integration

Copy the example workflow to any project:

```bash
cp ~/dotfiles/.github/workflows/markdownlint.yml.example .github/workflows/markdownlint.yml
```

This will run markdownlint on all markdown files in pull requests and pushes.

### Customization

- **Global config**: Edit `~/dotfiles/markdown/.markdownlint.yaml`
- **Project-specific**: Create `.markdownlint.yaml` in your project root
- **Add abbreviations**: Edit `~/dotfiles/shared/abbreviations.yaml` and run `reload-abbr`

## About Neovim Distributions

> [!TIP]
> **TL;DR:** Just install [LazyVim][lazyvim]üí§

üì∫ [Zero to IDE with LazyVim][zero-to-ide-lazyvim-video]

Back in the day if you wanted to use Vim (and later Neovim) you had to code a ton of configuration on your own. With Vim we got Vimscript ü§¢, but then came Neovim which brought us Lua ü§©. I went from ye olde crunchy `.vimrc` to the more adventurous `init.vim` to the blessed path of `init.lua`. üòá

Meanwhile, there were the VS Code boys across the fence, bragging about their fancy icons, shiny tabs, and the oh-so-cool LSP. I confess, I even tried VS Code for a bit. That didn't last long. üò¨

But Neovim has caught up. And wow have they. caught. up. Not only do we have native LSP support in Neovim (have had for a while now ‚Äî v0.5), but we are solidly in the era of pre-baked Neovim distributions that are really challenging the notion of Vim/Neovim as austere, command-line editors. (I will say that I think we owe a lot to VS Code for raising the bar here. But I'm still glad I'm with Neovim. üòâ)

If you want a quick primer on Neovim distros, **check out the YouTube video below**. I started with [LunarVim][lunar-vim] (my first entry into distro-land) and now I'm with [LazyVim][lazyvim] and the [Folke gang][folke]. Bottom line: you can still config [Neovim from scratch][neovim-from-scratch] if you want to, but you can get a HUGE head-start by just grabbing a distro and tweaking it to your needs.

üì∫ [I tried Neovim Distributions so you don't have to][i-tried-neovim-distros-video]

Boy, when I reminisce about the days of writing PHP for Internet Explorer in BBEdit...

## My Favorite Programming Fonts

Over the years, I‚Äôve branched out to explore a variety of mono-spaced fonts, both free and premium. Here is a list of my favorites.

### Free Fonts

_Included in my `Brewfile` and installed by default via [Homebrew Cask Fonts][homebrew-cask-fonts]_

- [Cascadia Code][cascadia-code]
- [Fira Code][fira-code]
- [Hack][hack]
- [JetBrains Mono][jetbrains-mono]
- [Monaspace Argon][monaspace]
- [Monaspace Neon][monaspace]
- [Symbols Nerd Font Mono][symbols-nerd-font-mono] (for icons only)

### Premium Fonts

_You have to give people money if you want these._ ü§ë

- [Operator Mono][operator-mono]
- [MonoLisa][monolisa]
- [Comic Code][comic-code]

### Ligatures

I first discovered ligatures through [Fira Code][fira-code], which IMHO is probably the king of programming fonts. After using Fira Code, it‚Äôs hard to go back to a sans-ligature typeface. Therefore all the fonts I‚Äôve included in my fave‚Äôs list _do_ include ligatures, although some have more than others.

> [!NOTE]
> Operator Mono does not include ligatures but [can be easily patched][operator-mono-lig] to add them.

## Nerd Fonts and Icons

Back in the day, I started using the [VimDevicons][devicons] plugin so I could have fancy file-type icons in Vim. (Remember NERDTree?) In order for this to work, one had to install patched ‚ÄúNerd-font‚Äù versions of whatever programming font one wanted to use. For example:

```sh
# Original font
$ brew install --cask font-fira-code

# Patched variant
$ brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

Patching fonts with icons still works fine of course, and is, I think, pretty widely used. However, during my exploration of kitty, I discovered that [there is a different (better?) approach](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#kitty-is-not-able-to-use-my-favorite-font) to icon fonts. It turns out, you don't need a patched version of your chosen mono-spaced font. You can get most if not all the icons you need and use them alongside _any_ font by just installing the `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` font.

Leveraging this approach depends on your terminal. In iTerm2, for example, you need to check ‚ÄúUse a different font for non-ASCII text‚Äù in the Preferences panel. Then select `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` font under ‚ÄúNon-ASCII font‚Äù. (see screenshot below)

![iterm2-font-settings][iterm2-font-settings]

kitty does things a little differently. If you install a patched font, it will mostly work. Mostly. But the ‚Äúkitty way‚Äù can be broken down in three steps:

1. Install a normal, un-patched mono-spaced font, such as `Cascadia Code`
2. Install a dedicated icon font, such as `Symbols Nerd Font Mono`
3. Create a set of Unicode symbol maps[^2] to tell kitty which font to use for which icons (symbols)

More work up front, maybe, but less guesswork in the long-term once you understand what's going on. And if you're using my dotfiles, you have it easy. **All the fonts you need are installed in `Brewfile`, and I have a set of Unicode symbol maps ready to go.** üòé

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about Nerd fonts in terminals, as well as Unicode symbol maps and all the rest, be sure to check out [Effective Nerd Fonts in Multiple Terminals](https://youtu.be/mQdB_kHyZn8?si=1mY6_oXEE8hr8lAp&t=289) by [Elijah Manor](https://www.youtube.com/@ElijahManor)

### üß™ Nerd Font Smoke Test

If you want to check whether icons and ligatures are working properly, try running the included `nerd-font-smoke-test.sh` script from the root of the `dotfiles` folder like so:

```sh
bash nerd-font-smoke-test.sh
```

If your terminal is configured correctly, the output of the test should look like this:

![smoke-test-output][smoke-test-output]

## A Note about Vim performance and Ruby files

Once upon a time, I almost left Vim due to some crippling performance issues. These issues were particularly painful when editing Ruby files. I documented what I learned here:

&#9657; [What I‚Äôve learned about slow performance in Vim](https://gist.github.com/joshukraine/3bfff4e9b553624b09789bc02cdd0ce6)

## Identifying Sources of Slow Startup Times (Zsh)

The `.zshrc` script can be profiled by touching the file `~/.zshrc.profiler` and starting a new login shell. To see the top 20 lines that are taking the most time use the `zshrc_profiler_view`. `zshrc_profiler` parameters are number of lines to show (20) and path to profiler log file (`$TMPDIR/zshrc_profiler.${PID}log`).
